# OAN Root Services

Root-side service workspace for OpenAgenet.

This repository owns:

Shared protocol, crypto, storage, service-security, and publication event
crates live in the sibling `oan-protocol-common` repository.

Integration tests and benchmarks are run from `oan-examples`. Service-node
identity material is copied from `oan-design-docs/genesis/nodes` into per-run
work directories; this repository does not own genesis private material.
